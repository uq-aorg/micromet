Including the three EC units owned by Civil Engineering there are five CR3000 data loggers available. While of various ages, these loggers have the same hardware configuration and only require some basic attention in terms of maintenance; any major issues will almost certainly require the logger be sent to Campbell Scientific for servicing, but the first step should always be to refer to the user manual.

The most common maintenance that we will need to perform consists of changing the battery and updating the logger operating system. Instructions for both of these procedures are found in the manual. Operating system updates are done with Device Configuration Utility, an application that comes with Loggernet.
