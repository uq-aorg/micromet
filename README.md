# CRG micromet

The major type of micromet observational capability available to the CRG is in the form of eddy covariance (EC) units. We have access to multiple EC units and a variety of mounting platforms, consisting of pontoons, tripods, and a variety of masts. There are several options for mounting arms on which to attach the instruments.

Processing code for flux data is currently nearing completion. The existing form of this code is written in Matlab and consists of standalone scripts. A future goal may be to have these packaged into a GUI for easy use. It is strongly recommended that raw 10 Hz be downloaded and archived for either all processing to occur using these raw data (with the addition of the slow sensors, stored in the flux table) or to use for verification of the flux data.

More detail about the equipment and processing recources, and suggestions for its successful use, will be added in the future.
